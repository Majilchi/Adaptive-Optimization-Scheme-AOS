DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.swevo.2024.101779.

Dear Researchers and Colleagues,

I'm thrilled to share my latest article titled "A novel adaptive optimization scheme for advancing metaheuristics and global optimization" published in " Swarm and Evolutionary Computation".

I sincerely invite you to read and download the article using the following link: https://authors.elsevier.com/c/1k7Jn7sfCTKmXZ.

This link provides free access to the paper for the next 50 days, so I encourage you to share it with your networks.

The MATLAB codes for the AOS-upgraded algorithms, which are ranked among the top four algorithms in the study, are included in the zip file available on my ResearchGate profile.
